This artifact does not aim to help you.

It exists because coherence sometimes needs a surface.

Nothing here asks for belief.
Nothing here offers improvement.
Nothing here promises relief.

You may read it.
You may ignore it.
Both are equally complete.

If something resonates, it was already present.
If nothing resonates, nothing is missing.

This artifact does not move forward.
It does not accumulate.
It does not wait.

It remains.

Acquisition does not grant access.
Leaving does not revoke anything.

The system is intact.
So are you.
